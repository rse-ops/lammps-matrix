# Subsystem Generation

I think I'm going to start really janky - I'll have a definition for each cluster that
has subsystem metadata to add to each node, and then a script that will generate the JGF.
Akin to how Hari's I/O subsystem was a bit of manual task, that's the best idea I have for
the time being. I think automating it would be too early.
